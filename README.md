# Basic Setup
1) Get some .nds homebrew. (You can get some [here](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/List_of_DS_homebrew_applications))
2) Start Relaunch and hold `A` and `B` or `A` and `X`.
3) Head to Options and choose your hotkey apps.
4) Start Relaunch again and hold the button corresponding to the app you want to launch.


## Advanced Usage

- You can edit the `Relaunch.ini` file and set custom paths, names, and file extensions for your files, you can also do this in the Relaunch menu.
- Hold `A` + `B` or `A` + `X` on boot in order to open the menu.
- There are prebuilt nightlies of Relaunch avaliable on [Universal-Team/extras/Relaunch](https://github.com/Universal-Team/extras/tree/master/builds/Relaunch)

#### Autobooting into Relaunch
- If you use an `r4isdhc.com` or `r4i-sdhc.com` card, get the zip file from [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/extras/raw/hidden/builds/Relaunch/relaunchautoboot.zip), extract it to the microSD card root, then rename `Relaunch.nds` to `boot.nds` and place it on the root of your microSD card. Please note that this will make YSMenu become the B button hotkey application.
- If you use DSiWarehax, rename `Relaunch.nds` to `boot.nds` and place it on the root of the SD card.
