# Basic Setup
1) Get some .nds homebrew. (You can get some [here](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/List_of_DS_homebrew_applications))
2) Name your .nds files `boot#.nds` with # being one of these buttons; `A`, `B`, `X`, `Y`, `Start`, `Select`, `R`, `L` `Left`, `Right`, `Down`, `Up`, or `Touch`.
3) Put all of your files into `/_nds/Relaunch/extras/`, if you set custom paths in the .ini file you don't need to do this.
4) Boot Relaunch and hold the button corresponding to the file you want to launch.

## Advanced Usage

- You can edit the `Relaunch.ini` file and set custom paths, names, and file extensions for your files.
- If you read the line above, you know about custom paths, you can do this in the Relaunch Menu as well!
- Hold `A` + `B` on boot in order to open the menu.
- There are prebuilt nightly builds of Relaunch found on [TWLBot](https://github.com/TWLBot/overflow-builds)
