<h3 align= "center">How To Use</h3>
</p>

- 1.) Get some .nds homebrew. (You can get some [here](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/List_of_DS_homebrew_applications))

- 2.) Name your .nds files boot#.nds with # being one of these buttons; `A`, `B`, `X`, `Y`, `Start`, `Select`, `R`, `L` `Left`, `Right`, `Down`, `Up`, or `Touch`. Alternatively, you can edit the `Relaunch.ini` file and set custom paths, names, and file extensions for your files.

- 3.) Put all of your files into `/_nds/Relaunch/extras/`, if you set custom paths in the .ini file you don't need to do this.

- 4.) Boot Relaunch and hold the button corresponding to the file you want to launch.

- Also, Hold A and B on boot to open the menu.

- Would you like to try Nightlies of Relaunch? They're right here! :D <https://github.com/TWLBot/overflow-builds>
